    Description = """
        Compare statistics for two independent distributed-trace queries and/or time windows.
        Use matching named aggregations and grouping keys in both queries; the backend validates shape compatibility.
        Returns joined current/compareTo/diff rows and coverage metadata without ranking or removing rows.
        Unlike selection-based attribute comparison, the populations can have disjoint time windows.
        Requires resource-group, workspace, query, start-time and end-time, plus compare-query
        or both comparison timestamps. Subscription may be omitted when an Azure CLI default is available.
        Omitted comparison fields inherit the current population.
        A running result includes an operationId; continue with monitor traces query resume, never resubmit.
        Azure public cloud only; the caller needs workspace read access. Feature-disabled API errors surface directly.
